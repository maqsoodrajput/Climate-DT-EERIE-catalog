## Check the catalogs

To check that your changes to the catalog are correct, you can use the aqua code and run the following command:

```bash
aqua add catalog_name -e /path/to/repo/catalogs/catalog_name
```

If you want to know more on the AQUA code, please refer to the [AQUA documentation](https://aqua.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
This test can also be run in the CI/CD pipeline, please set the label as `ready to merge` to enable the test.
It is a requirement to successfully pass the test before merging the PR.
